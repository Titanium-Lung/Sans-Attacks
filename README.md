# How to Play

These are Custom Attacks I have made for jcw87's [Bad Time Simulator](https://jcw87.github.io/c2-sans-fight). 

To use, download the CSV file that you want to play the attack of, navigate to the Bad Time Simulator (linked above), go to __Custom attack__, __Load file__, select the csv file you downloaded, and press __Run attack__.

# The Attacks

_Claustrophobia.csv_ is a fun full fight with silly Sans dialogue. _Stronger.csv_ was made for a music video, so is more meant to be watched than played. _Burn.csv_ is still a work in progress.
