# How to Play

These are Custom Attacks I have made for jcw87's [Bad Time Simulator](https://jcw87.github.io/c2-sans-fight). 

To use, download the CSV file that you want to play the attack of, navigate to the Bad Time Simulator (linked above), go to __Custom attack__, __Load file__, select the csv file you downloaded, and press __Run attack__.

# The Attacks

_Claustrophobia.csv_ is currently my only finished attack. _Cool Attack Name.csv_ is a work in progress, and the rest are tests.
